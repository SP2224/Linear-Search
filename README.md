# Linear-Search-in-python, c and c++

The time complexity of above algorithm is O(n).
Linear search is the simplest searching algorithm that searches for an element in a list in sequential order. We start at one end and check every element until the desired element is not found.


# APPROACH
>>Start from the leftmost element of arr[] and one by one compare x with each element of arr[]
>>If x matches with an element, return the index.
>>If x doesnâ€™t match with any of elements, return -1.
